# Maze-solving-robot

This project is an implmentation of an autonomous robot which follows a derivative of Wall Follower (Left-Hand) algorithm using appropriate sensors. The robot acts according to the code written in Arduino, which directs it to explore the maze containing random turns. The robot is autonomous and follows a derivative of wall following algorithm.

### Description

Modern robotics technologies are focused on developing self-navigating autonomous robots to automate our day-to-day processes. The aim for this project is to build a robot that is able find a path without any assistance or help in a given maze. As a type of autonomous robot, it has to decode the path on its own to solve the maze successfully. So itâ€™s logic is quite different from the line following robot which follows a predetermined route. So, in this project I built a robot that traverses a maze and outputs the shortest path to the user after the robot has traversed the whole maze once using appropriate senors.

### Features

  *  Implementation of the Wall Follower algorithm.
  *  Infrared sensor mounted on the bottom, enables the robot to traverse the maze with a smooth and refined movement.
  *  Ultrasonic sensor mounted on the top of the robot, gives vision to the robot to avoid any obstacle.

### Outcome

The robot is capable of sucessfully traversing the entire maze and implementing the devised algorithm outputting a shortest path for the maze. With the exception of the battery, the device is self-contained, housing all electrical, mechanical, and software components within its frame.


### Future Uses

  * These can be used in fire figthing applications where there is more human loss, for example to find the shortest path   in the building that has been caught in fire.
  * These can be used in military grade applications, for determining the most efficient path.
  * Other applications include: Material Handling, Warehouse Managmanet, Pipe Inspection, Bomb Disposal etc.

# Maze-solving-robot

This project is an implementation of an autonomous robot that follows a derivative of the Wall Follower (Left-Hand) algorithm using appropriate sensors. The robot acts according to the code written in Arduino, which directs it to explore the maze containing random turns.

### Description

Modern robotics technologies are focused on developing self-navigating autonomous robots to automate our day-to-day processes. This project aims to build a robot that can find a path without any assistance or help in a given maze. As a type of autonomous robot, it has to decode the path on its own to solve the maze successfully. So its logic is quite different from the line following robot which follows a predetermined route. So, this project introduces a robot that can traverse a maze completely and output the shortest path to the user, using necessary sensors.

### Features

  *  Able to determine the shortest path just from the first complete traversal of the maze.
  *  Infrared sensor mounted on the bottom, enables the robot to traverse the maze with a smooth and refined movement.
  *  Ultrasonic sensor mounted on the top of the robot, gives vision to the robot to avoid any obstacle.

### Outcome

The robot is capable of successfully traversing the entire maze and implementing the devised algorithm outputting the shortest path for the maze. With the exception of the battery, the device is self-contained, housing all electrical, mechanical, and software components within its frame.

### Future Uses

  * These can be used by fire figthing agencies where there is more human loss, for example to determine the shortest path in the building.
  * These can be used in military grade applications, for determining the most efficient/shortest path.
  * Other uses include: Material Handling, Warehouse Managmanet, Pipe Inspection, Bomb Disposal etc.
